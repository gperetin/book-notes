# Chapter 2: Functional Programming

## BASICS
* there are 3 different types of declarations
  * value declaration : let
  * exception declaration : exception
  * type declaration : type

* toplevel prints 3 things:
  * val fact : int -> int = <fun>
  * <name> : <type> = <value>

* string concatenation operator is ^
  * `"ASDASD" ^ "dddd"`

* type `int * string` is the type of pairs whose first element is an integer (of type `int`) and whose second is a character string (of type `string`)

* tuples
  * `let t = (12, "test")`
  * values of different types, cartesian product

* lists = [1;2;3];;
  * values of the same type
  * concatenating lists operator is @
  * `[1] @ [2;3];;`


## VALUE DECLARATIONS
* Global declaration:
  * `let year = 2003;`

* Local declaration:
  * `let year = 2003 in ...`

* function declaration is the same as value declaration:
  * `let func_name param1 param2 = param1 + param2;;`

* type constraints:
  * let add (x:int) (y:int) = x + y;;


## PATTERN MATCHING
* syntax:
    ```
    match <expr> with
    | <p1> -> <expr1>
    | <p2> -> <expr2>
    ```

* `<expr>` is matched sequentially


## TYPE DECLARATIONS
* two major families of types:
  * product types (records and tuples)
  * sum types (unions)
* type declarations are recursive by default
* syntax:
    `type <name> = <typedef>;;`
* they can be parametrized by type variables which begin with '
    `type 'a <name> = <typedef>;;`


## RECORDS
* record always corresponds to the declaration of a new type
    ```
    type <name> = {
        <name1> : t1;
        <name2> : t2
    };;
    ```

* creating a record:
    `lec c = {re=2.; im=3.}`

* there are 2 ways to get a field in a record: dot notation and pattern matching


## SUM TYPES
* corresponds to a union of sets
* declaration:
    ```
    type <name> = 
        | Name1 ....
        | Name2 of type2 ...
        | Name3 of type3 * type4
    ```

* constant constructor - constructor which doesn't take an argument

* = is structural equality (compares values)
* == is physical equality (compares memory addresses)


# Chapter 3: Imperative programming


## MODIFIABLE DATA STRUCTURES
* vectors (Arrays)
* strings
* records with mutable fields
* references


### VECTORS
* one dimensional array
* collect a known number of elements of the same type
* `# let v = [| 3.14; 6.28; 9.42 |] ;;`
* `# v.(1)`
* `# v.(0) <- 100.`
* Array module in standard library

* **Atomic values** - values whose size does not exceed the standard
size of OCaml values (one memory word are)
  * integers, characters, booleans and constant constructors

* **Structured values** - are represented by a pointer into memory area
  * vectors of floats are a special case - creation of vector of floats causes
  initial value to be copied (even though vectors are structured)


### STRINGS
* `let s = "hello";;`
* `s.[2] <- 'r';;`


### MUTABLE FIELDS OF RECORDS
* `# type point = { mutable xc : float; mutable yc : float } ;;`
* use mutable keyword to mark field in a record mutable
* `# let p = { xc = 1.0; yc = 0.0 } ;;`
* `# p.xc <- 3.0;;`


### REFERENCES
* can be seen as the type of a pointer to any value
* it's basically a record with one mutable field contents
* `# let x = ref 3;;`
* `# !x (get the value of a ref)`
* `# x := 4;;`

* weak type variables: `val x : â€™_a list ref = {contents=[]}`
* `'_a` is unknown type awaiting instantiation


## INPUT-OUTPUT
* IO functions often return `unit` type
* predefined types: `in_channel` and `out_channel`
* `open_in` and `open_out`, function for opening channels
* `close_in` and `close_out`, for closing
* `input_line ic` - reads a line from ic channel
    ```
    # let () = print_string "and one, " in
        print_string "zero";;
    ```


## IMPERATIVE CONTROL STRUCTURES

### SEQUENCE
* left to right evaluation of a sequence of expressions separated by ;
* `expr1 ; .... ; exprn`
* `print_string "test"; 1+1;;`
* use function `ignore` to ignore value of any expressions in a sequence
* sequences can be delimited by ( ) or begin/end blocks

### LOOPS
* for loop for a bounded iteration
* while loop for non-bounded iteration
* `# for i=1 to 10 do print int i; print string " " done; print newline() ;;`


# Chapter 18: Communucation and Processes

* errors produced by system calls throw Unix_error exceptions
* Unix.handle_unix_error - wraps function call and handles error
* open file or create it if it doesn't exist
    `let file = Unix.openfile "test.dat" [Unix.O_RDWR; Unix.O_CREAT] 0o644 ;;`
    or (if using JS Core stdlib)
    `let file = Unix.openfile "test.dat" ~mode:[Unix.O_RDWR; Unix.O_CREAT]
    ~perm:0o644 ;;`
* conversion functions between file descriptors and `in_channel`/`out_channel`
  from `Pervasives`
    `Unix.in_channel of descr ;;`
    `Unix.descr of in_channel ;;`

## Processes
* exit the program with `Pervasives.exit`
* to create a process, use `Unix.create_process`
* spawn a subprocess and wait for it to finish: `Sys.command` or `Unix.system`
* `Unix.fork` to fork off current process
* `Unix.wait` wait for child to finish

## Communication Between Processes
* pipes
  * `let output, input = Unix.pipe();;` create a pipe and get both ends
  * named pipe - `Unix.mkfifo;;`
* communication channels
  * `Unix.open_process` - takes a string (path which will be executed by
  `/bin/sh` and returns a pair STDIN, STDOUT
  * `Unix.close_process (in, out);;` - closes previously opened process
* signals
  * module `Sys` contains POSIX signals, module `Unix` has `kill` command
  * `Unix.kill <PID> <SIGNAL>`;;
  * redefine signal handling `Sys.set_signal <SIGNAL> <HANDLER>;;`
